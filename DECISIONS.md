This is the file containing our decision and argumentations on those during our minitwit project

## REWRITING MINITWIT IN GO

The decision to go with Go (pun intended :)) was based on the following reasons:

- minimalistic language with an extensive standard library
- fast, lightweight and scalable
- strongly and statically typed (an advantage over python)
- concurrency is an integral part supported by goroutines and channels
- programs are constructed from packages that offer clear code separation
- google APIs are often written in Go, it would be nice to follow those implementations
- check the hype out???
