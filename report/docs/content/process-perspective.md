# Process' perspective

##A description and illustration of:


  - How do you interact as developers?
  - How is the team organized?
  - A complete description of stages and tools included in the CI/CD chains.
    -  That is, including deployment and release of your systems.
  - Organization of your repositor(ies).
    - That is, either the structure of of mono-repository or organization of artifacts across repositories.
    - In essence, it has to be be clear what is stored where and why.
  - Applied branching strategy.

A feature based branching strategy has been used for this project, that is anytime a team member desires to add a new feature, a new branch with the name of that feature is created. Once the changes has been implemented a pull-request is made and reviewed by another team member before it is merged with the development branch. 

  - Applied development process and tools supporting it
    - For example, how did you use issues, Kanban boards, etc. to organize open tasks
  - How do you monitor your systems and what precisely do you monitor?
  - What do you log in your systems and how do you aggregate logs?
  - Brief results of the security assessment.
  - Applied strategy for scaling and load balancing.
